1. Trained the last layer with lab images *for robustness*
    * Reduction in accuracy
2. Trained the entire network with modified lab images *for accuracy*
    * Reduction in accuracy
    * Most values were at 0(Nan)
3. Trying to retrain the last layer with different training rates to achieve better ac
